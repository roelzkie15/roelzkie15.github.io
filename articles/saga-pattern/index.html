                In a monolithic system, a database transaction should ensure consistent query results after a successful request.
                Otherwise, it should rollback all the commits that were made to the previous state (Atomicity).
                Atomic transaction is common and easily achievable in a single database system.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, in a distributed system you may need to handle this differently ensuring data consistency across multiple services
                and where each service have its own database. So traditional ACID approach wouldn't work.
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4 id="problem">Problem</h4>
                <p>
                    For example, we have three services: <b>Payment service</b>, <b>Invoicing service</b> and <b>Debtor service</b>.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    <div>
                        <img src="/images/articles/saga-pattern/database-per-service.png" alt="database-per-service-illustration">
                    </div>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Imagine a debtor initiate a full payment to an invoice and we want to capture that transaction
                    through the payment service then set the invoice status into "paid" and update the debtor outstanding balance.
                </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Solution</h4>

                <p>
                    One of the most common approach to achieve transaction that spans multiple services is by using the Saga Pattern.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A Saga is a sequence of local transactions and each transaction will publish messages or events that trigger the
                    next local transaction.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If something goes wrong to a participating microservice, there should be a compensating transaction to undo the changes that were
                    made by the preceding local transactions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now there are two popular Saga based approaches.

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Choreography-based Saga</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Orchestration-based Saga</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Choreography-based Saga Example</h4>

                <p>
                    It is when microservices publish a message/event from a local transaction and trigger subscribers or participating microservices
                    for the next local transaction. See image below as an example that solves the given <a href="#problem">Problem</a>:

                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The <code>Payment Service</code> will create a payment transaction and produce an <code>Invoice Update Event</code>.</li>
                        <li>The <code>Invoice Service</code> listens to this event to update the given invoice status to <code>paid</code>.</li>
                        <li>This will also produce <code>Debtor Update Event</code> signaling the <code>Debtor Service</code> for the next operation.</li>
                        <li>The <code>Debtor Service</code> listens to this event and do the outstanding calculation update.</li>
                        <li>It will then produce an <code>Outstanding Deducted Event</code> that will communicate back to the <code>Payment Service</code>.</li>
                        <li>The <code>Payment Service</code> receives an updated that a successful debtor outstanding balance was reflected ending the payment transaction flow.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                        <li>This will also produce <code>Debtor Update Event</code> signaling the <code>Debtor Service</code> for the next operation.</li>
                        <li>The <code>Debtor Service</code> listens to this event and do the outstanding calculation update. <u>However, this operation failed to update debtor outstanding balance for some reason e.g. a validation error</u>.</li>
                        <li>The <code>Debtor Service</code> will trigger a new event called <code>Invoice Revert Event</code> to instruct the <code>Invoice Service</code> of the next operation.</li>
                        <li>The <code>Invoice Service</code> receives the event and will revert the invoice status back to <code>created</code>.</li>
                        <li>It will then produce a <code>Payment Revert Event</code> to signal the <code>Payment Service</code>.</li>
                        <li>The <code>Payment Service</code> receives the event and ending the transaction with a failed payment process.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <h5>Benefits and drawbacks</h5>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>No additional complexity for coordination logic.</li>
                    <li>Very simple and easy to implement with smaller workflows.</li>
                    <li>Hard to maintain when it grows.</li>
                    <li>Cyclic dependency between participating services.</li>
                    <li>Hard to tests as you will need to run all applications that are involved.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h4>Orchestration-based Saga Example</h4>

                <p>
                    It is when microservices have an orchestrator to command what participating microservices should trigger the next local transaction.
                    The participating microservices should send a reply back to the local orchestrator before triggering the next service.
                </p>
